Issues:
1.I write all the scenarios in one .feature file, which makes the StepDefiniton a bit complex.
2.When face the login user story, i want to test the combination of numbers and words so that i write in scenarios outlin which i don't know if this means i have more than 9 scenarios.
3.Some examples in log in with incorrect password and incorrect username failed because my ip address be screened(also include empty field).
4.The testrun.class can run directly.
5.Mac system used when coding.
6.Many same steps existed, i don't know if that means over-testing.
7.The user story and scenarios are described in three .feature files(HomePage.feature, Login.feature, Search.feature)
